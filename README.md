# PetsApp

In Petsapp the architectural pattern used is MVVM, Have implemented few test cases. Presented the userinterface and validated based on the task description.

### Description
Step 1: If you launch the app the app would check for the configuration settings for the shop working hours that is from 9.00 - 6.00, So if the current time lies between those time range we will show the list of pets data.You can click on the list screen to view the detail screen.


Step 2: If you launch the app when the current time is not in the shop working hours range we will display that the shop is closed.
